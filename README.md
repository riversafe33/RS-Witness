I create and share digital tools with passion and purpose.

I'm under no pressure to donate, but if my work has helped you, please don't hesitate to contribute.

Witness system when attacking NPCs

1 - If you attack NPCs, the Sheriffs will be notified.

2 - If you are wearing a bandana, only your location will be shown; if not, your name will also appear in the notification.

3 - Your position, along with a blip and a notification, will be sent to the Sheriffs every 30 seconds for a total of 5 minutes.

4 - Option to exclude NPCs from sending notifications in the config.lua (for bounty hunting scripts or missions).
