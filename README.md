Witness system when attacking NPCs

1 - If you attack NPCs, the Sheriffs will be notified.

2 - If you are wearing a bandana, only your location will be shown; if not, your name will also appear in the notification.

3 - Your position, along with a blip and a notification, will be sent to the Sheriffs every 30 seconds for a total of 5 minutes.

4 - Option to exclude NPCs from sending notifications in the config.lua (for bounty hunting scripts or missions).
